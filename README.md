# Microservices Architecture Project for the Graduation Thesis at Nha Trang University.

## 📖 Overview  
This project is designed using a **microservices architecture** to provide a scalable and maintainable system. It is developed as part of the **graduation thesis at Nha Trang University**. 
## 🚀 Features 
- **User Authentication & Authorization** (JWT, Firebase Authentication)
- **Service-to-Service Communication** (REST API / gRPC)  
- **Database Management** (MongoDB, SQL Server, Redis) 
- **File Uploads** (MEGA Drive API, Cloudinary) 
- **Logging & Monitoring** (Serilog, ELK Stack) 
- **Caching Mechanism** (Redis)  
## 🏗️ Project Architecture  
The system consists of multiple independent services, including: 
1. **API Gateway** – Handles request routing, authentication, and rate limiting.  
2. **User Service** – Manages user registration, authentication, and profiles.
